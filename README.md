# Graph Database plugin for IntelliJ Platform

This plugin adds support for graph databases to the IntelliJ IDEA platform.
At the moment, the only supported database is Neo4j.

The plugin provides useful developer features for working with graph databases, such as:
* syntax highlighting and autocompletion for 
the [Cypher](https://opencypher.org/) query language
* connecting to and querying local and remote graph databases.

This plugin is maintained and developed in my free time as a personal project,
for no commercial reasons.
Contributions and donations are welcome! Please see the [Getting involved](#getting-involved)
section for more information on how to contribute to this project.

This plugin is based on the
[Graph Database Support](https://github.com/neueda/jetbrains-plugin-graph-database-support)
plugin, originally developed by [Neueda Technologies](http://technologies.neueda.com/).
The original plugin has not been updated for a long time and does not work with recent versions of IntelliJ and Neo4j.

## Installation

The plugin can be installed directly within an IntelliJ IDEA-based IDE.

1. Go to `Preferences` -> `Plugins` -> `Marketplace`
2. Search for `Graph Database`.
3. Install plugin and restart the IDE.

Alternatively, you can navigate to the [plugin homepage](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20417-graph-database)
on the JetBrains marketplace and click on the 'Install' button.

## Usage

### Data Sources

After the plugin is installed, you should configure a data source. In order to do that,
expand the "Graph Database" tab on the right-hand side of the IDE, then click on the "+" symbol.
Fill in the fields, and test that the connection works.

### Cypher syntax highlighting

The plugin activates syntax highlighting for Cypher for files with extensions `.cyp`, `.cypher`, or `.cql`.

It is also possible to add syntax highlighting to Java Strings containing Cypher queries
via [language injection](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-language-injections.html).
Simply add the following comment right before a Cypher String:
```java
// language=Cypher
```

## Building the plugin

### Dependencies

The plugin depends on JDK17 and the latest release of IntelliJ. Please make sure
you have those installed on your machine.

Moreover, if you plan on making changes to a grammar or lexer files, you also need
to install the [Grammar-Kit](https://github.com/JetBrains/Grammar-Kit) IntelliJ plugin.

### Build instructions

If you changed a grammar or lexer files, you need to regenerate the lexer and parser classes.
Please follow the instructions at [Grammar-Kit](https://github.com/JetBrains/Grammar-Kit)
in order to do that.

After that, the plugin can be built with a simple Gradle command:

```shell
./gradlew :graph-database-plugin:buildPlugin
```

Before a release, the plugin should also be tested and verified with the following commands:

```shell
./gradlew test
./gradlew :graph-database-plugin:runPluginVerifier
```

The plugin can also be manually tested on a sandboxed instance of IntelliJ with the command:

```shell
./gradlew :graph-database-plugin:runIde
```
